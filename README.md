Concepts used:
  Custom-Class - It is the game design, the code behind the game
  Lists - we used lists for aspects like snake length, adding more items that relates to the snake-length(When the snake keep on eating food) and keeping record of the score for the player.
  Random class - It helped more in placing the food around the board, because there should'nt be a pattern in the food placing but random coordinates.
  Jframe - Helps us represent the code visually.
  Event class - get events from user input to control their snake and navigate throught the app
