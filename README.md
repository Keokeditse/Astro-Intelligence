Instructions for the use(allowed actions): 
  The game won't require internet access to run.
  If the user has the full version of the game, they'll simply have to click on the game application on an android device and the game will run smoothly(ONLY  if the android device is version 10 and above).
  After the program has ran smoothly and the user can interact with the system. Reading through the game GUI for navigation and how to play it and the application will provide basic steps on how to play the game.
  After first attempt, surely the user will be familiar with the game and will now know how to navigate through the app and play the game.
  
Tools used: 
  Processing 4 - Mainly for the demo version and GUI designs.
  Andriod Studio - compile the game and develop it.
  LibGDX  - used as external library used to create controlls
  
Concepts used:
  Custom-Class - It is the game design, the code behind the game.
  Lists - we used lists for aspects like snake length, adding more items that relates to the snake-length(When the snake keep on eating food) and keeping record of the score for the player.
  Random class - It helped more in placing the food around the board, because there should'nt be a pattern in the food placing but random coordinates.
  Jframe - Helps us represent the code visually.
  Event class - get events from user input to control their snake and navigate throught the app.
  Abstraction - To break down the game into smaller parts making the code easier to use and debug.
  
Assumptions: 
  The game will run on any andriod device from version 10 upwards.
  The user interface should be simple and easy to use and appealing.
  Our game will run smoothly and not use too much memory.
  
Limitation: 
  Learning different languages on our own to make certain features that we want our game to have.
  Implementing high quality graphics in our game.
  Implementing animations and music in our game.
